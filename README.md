PawChain "Where every pawprint leaves a trace."

Each pet is represented by a unique soulbound NFT (SBT) on Mantle, containing their identity, ownership, health records, and behavioral history. This NFT evolves over time and can only be transferred between verified shelters, clinics, or owners (with consent).
